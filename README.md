# Employee Management System - SQL Project

This project is a simple **Employee Management System** built using SQL. It demonstrates the use of **relational databases**, **foreign keys**, and various SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, and querying data.

## Database Schema

The database consists of the following tables:
- **departments**: Stores department information.
- **employees**: Stores employee information, including their department.
- **salaries**: Stores the salary details for employees.

## Project Files

- **create_tables.sql**: SQL script to create the required tables.
- **insert_data.sql**: SQL script to insert sample data into the tables.
- **queries.sql**: SQL queries to interact with the data (e.g., retrieve employees, update salaries).

## How to Run

1. Create a database in your preferred SQL environment.
2. Run the `create_tables.sql` script to create the tables.
3. Run the `insert_data.sql` script to insert sample data.
4. Use the queries from `queries.sql` to interact with the data.

## Example Queries

1. Retrieve all employees and their department names.
2. Update an employee's salary.
3. Delete an employee record.
4. Retrieve employees with a salary greater than a specified amount.
